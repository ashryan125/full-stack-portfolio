WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume 
and a list of the developer’s proficiencies

WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter) 
```
